# FashionMNIST-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning

The [Dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is composed of small (28x28 pixels), grey-scale images of clothing items such as shoes, coats, pants, etc. It was created to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the well known [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. So the dataset shares the same image size and structure as the original MNIST.
