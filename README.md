# About the Project

The [Dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) is composed of small (28x28 pixels), grey-scale images of clothing items such as shoes, coats, pants, etc. It was created to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the well-known [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. So the dataset shares the same image size and structure as the original MNIST.
The label was originally an assigned clothing type represented by an integer from 0-9. The training set contains 60,000 examples and the test set 10,000 examples. We have created a new label based on the data and calculated to be associated with each entry.
